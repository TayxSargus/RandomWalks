    "# XKCD's Social Seating problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimising linear seating arrangements with a pseudo-genetic algorithm, implemented in python\n",
    "\n",
    "![XKCD comic 173](images/movie_seating.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Social groups are remarkably complex affairs, and on many occasions this complexity can lead to awkward situations. Randall Munroe humorously portrays one such example in XKCD #173. This comic naturally begs the question – how *do* we find the optimal arrangement?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not a fan of people trying to examine non-mathematical things in mathematical terms, now would be a good time to cut your losses (at least you got to see the XKCD comic!). Otherwise, don your cringe-protection glasses and we can move on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The precise problem here is that the nonlinear 'social graph' has to be compressed onto a linear arrangement; as the comic points out, this is computationally hard. Nevertheless, we can attempt to do this by using a genetic algorithm of sorts. But before that, we must firstly quantify the various parameters in this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Developing the initial model\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean for a seating arrangement to be optimal? I am going to take a disgustingly utilitarian approach, by simply calculating the enjoyment per individual for a certain arrangement then summing over all individuals to find the *total enjoyment*. The optimal arrangement is then just the one with the highest total enjoyment (duh).  Before going further, we must first decide on a way of describing social networks which will allow us to do this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examining a social network\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the XKCD comic, each individual be denoted by a circular node. We will consider four types of relationships between individuals: friends, one-way 'crushes', romantic relationships, and acquaintances. I'm going to slightly modify the notation of the comic though: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/relationship_types.png\" alt = \"Relationship types\" style=\"width:400px;\"\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The major advantage of this notation is that it encourages us to only consider the *outgoing* connections from a particular individual, which will be a big simplification when we come to considering an individual's enjoyment. But it is far from perfect. For example, this notation implies that a romantic relationship is the same as a mutual crush, i.e. that I would get as much enjoyment from sitting next to my crush as I would to my partner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proceeding anyway, we assign each type of outgoing arrow a weighting, corresponding to how much enjoyment an individual experiences when sitting with a person of that relation. Here is one proposed weighting:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Crush (arrowed line): $\\text{weight} = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Friend (solid line): $\\text{weight} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Acquaintance (dotted line): $\\text{weight} = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Stranger (no line): $\\text{weight} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the actual values are quite arbitrary – what matters is their relative ordering. I think it is fair to say that any individual's seating preferences follow the above list in descending order. That is, given free choice, you would enjoy most to sit next to your crush, and least enjoy sitting next to a stranger. Choosing precise weightings would require you to quantify exactly how much more you would prefer to sit with a crush than with a friend – good luck with that!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A quick example\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can *describe* a social network, let's try to calculate the total enjoyment for a seating arrangement.\n",
    "We may as well use the network given in the comic. Here it is reproduced with our new notation (labelling each individual with a letter of the alphabet): \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/xkcdgraphletters.png\" alt = \"the xkcd graph\" style=\"width:400px;\"\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If this group has to sit down in a line, they will form an arrangement\n",
    "that will be denoted by a sequence of letters. For example, the\n",
    "arrangement *BFGHECDA* represents *F* sitting to\n",
    "the right of *B*, *G* to the right of *F*, etc. For each of the\n",
    "8! possible arrangements, we could calculate a total enjoyment, denoted\n",
    "by $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}}$, which is done as follows. Consider the arrangement $ABCDEFGH$: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/xkcdline.png\" alt = \"linearised arrangement\" style=\"width:400px;\"\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that an individual can only be affected by the individuals immediately to their left or right, each individual can have up to two outgoing connections,  which can assume values of 2, 1, 0.5, or 0 depending on the relationship. For each individual, we add up these values, then to find $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ we just sum over all the individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easy to do with just one arrangement, but we need a robust way of finding $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}}$ for *any* arrangement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Refining the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Get ready, I am about to throw a lot of notation at you. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Let the number of individuals in a network be denoted by $n$. In the XKCD network, there are 8 individuals, so $n=8$.\n",
    "- Each individual will be arbitrarily labelled $1, 2, 3, \\ldots , n$, rather than using letters of the alphabet. \n",
    "- In order to define an individual's relationships with other members of the group, we will associate a vector $x_i$ with each individual in the group, where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. \n",
    "    - This vector contains one element for each member in the network (including itself). \n",
    "    - The $m$th entry of the vector $x_i$ encodes the enjoyment produced for individual $i$ by individual $m$. \n",
    "    - We will denote the $m$th row of the vector $x_i$ as $[i, m]$. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "That is a lot to take in, but hopefully this notation will become clearer with an example. Here is the XKCD network, with the letter labels replaced by numerals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/xkcdgraphnumbers.png\" alt = \"xkcd graph with numerals\" style=\"width:400px;\"\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sixth individual, we have: $ x_6 = \\langle 0,0,0,2,1,0,0.5,0 \\rangle $. Let's break this down to make sure we are on the same page: \n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first three entries (and the final one) are equal to zero,\n",
    "    because individual 6 has no relationship with individuals 1, 2, 3,\n",
    "    and 8 (i.e they are strangers to him). We could also write $[6,1] = [6,2] = [6,3] = [6,8] = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The fourth entry is equal to two, because individual 6 has a crush\n",
    "    on individual 4. We could also write $[6,4] = 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   The fifth entry is equal to one, because individual 6 is friends\n",
    "    with individual 5. We could also write $[6,5] = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The seventh entry is equal to a half, because individual 6 is an\n",
    "    acquaintance of individual 7. We could also write $[6,7] = 0.5$.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "You may notice that I neglected to mention the sixth entry of $x_6$. $[6, 6]$ represents the enjoyment produced for the sixth individual by the sixth individual. I suppose that some people enjoy themselves more when alone, but why would they go to the movie then? We will set this entry to zero. That is to say, if $i=m, [i,m] = 0$. In our model, individuals get no enjoyment from sitting next to themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a vector $x_i$ for every individual in our network. After doing this, *we do not need the graph any more* – our network is fully defined by these *n* vectors! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The total enjoyment for a general arrangement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will denote a general linear arrangement of individuals as \n",
    "$$u_1, u_2, u_3, \\ldots, u_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(earlier we had *ABCDEFGH*). You may be wondering why I have decided to add *yet another* variable – am I just trying to be novel in my notation? As it happens, there is a very important distinction between the individual's location ($u$) and the *label* of the individual ($i$). **$\\mathbf{u_1}$ is not the same as individual 1**. $u_1$ could be any of the people in the network – but what matters is that this individual is in the first position of the arrangement. That is to say that the $u$ terms are a way of representing the order of the people. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    u_1 &= 3 \\\\\n",
    "    u_2 &= 7 \\\\\n",
    "    u_3 &= 1 \\\\\n",
    "    u_4 &= 2 \\\\\n",
    "    u_5 &= 5  \\\\\n",
    "    u_6 &= 8 \\\\\n",
    "    u_7 &= 6  \\\\\n",
    "    u_8 &= 4 \n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "corresponds to a seating arrangement 3, 7, 1, 2, 5, 8, 6, 4 (remember, each numeral is the label of a person!). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$, we need to calculate the enjoyment for each $u$ term then take the sum of all these. Because of our simplification that an individual is only affected by the\n",
    "people immediately to their left or right, a neat trick is to group\n",
    "the arrangement into pairs. So we will think of the arrangement as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(u_1, u_2), (u_2,u_3), (u_3, u_4), \\ldots, (u_{n-2}, u_{n-1}),(u_{n-1}, u_n),$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where each pair of parentheses encloses the relationship between two individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is at this stage that we need to recall the previously-defined vector notation. Just as $x_6$ represents the relationship of individual 6 to the network, the vector representing individual $u_1$'s relationship to the network is $x_{u_1}$. Thus, the enjoyment produced in individual $u_1$ by individual $u_2$ can be\n",
    "found by looking in the $u_2$th entry of the vector $x_{u_1}$. This subscript-within-subscript notation is very confusing, which is why we defined an alternative notation, the square-bracket notation wherein $[i, m]$ represents the $m$th row of the vector $x_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation, the $u_2$th entry of the vector $x_{u_1}$ is simply written as $[u_1, u_2]$.\n",
    "However, note that in the pair $(u_1, u_2)$, individual $u_1$ also\n",
    "produces some enjoyment in $u_2$. Thus the total enjoyment produced\n",
    "within the pair $(u_1, u_2)$ is equal to: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$[u_1, u_2] + [u_2, u_1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all we need to do is sum over all the $n-1$ pairs. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_\\text{total} = \\sum_{r = 1}^{n-1} \\left( [u_r, u_{r+1}] + [u_{r+1}, u_r] \\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r$ is a dummy variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to the XKCD network\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ of a random arrangement. I'll choose this with my custom arrangement-randomiser:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def random_arrangement():\n",
    "    return [3, 2, 8, 5, 4, 6, 1, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we need to know the vectors $x_i$. These unfortunately have to be hard-coded based on the network. Earlier we showed the full form of $x_6$ and how we got there. Let's repeat the same process to find $x_i, i = 1,2,3,...,8$\n",
    "(because $n=8$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    x_1 &= \\langle 0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0 \\rangle \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$, we just need to apply our formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\epsilon_\\text{total} &= \\sum_{r = 1}^{n-1} \\left( [u_r, u_{r+1}] + [u_{r+1}, u_r] \\right) \\\\\n",
    "    &= [3, 2] + [2, 3] + [2, 8] + [8, 2] + \\ldots + [1, 7] + [7, 1]  \\\\\n",

    "    &= 9\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth commenting on the fact that all of the above values come in identical pairs (that is, $[u_r, u_{r+1}] = [u_{r+1}, u_r]$), which is **not true** generally. However, for this particular network, there is only one asymmetrical relationship, the one-way crush between individuals 7 and 8\n",
    "– and in our particular arrangement, 7 is not next to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have found $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ without our vector notation, and simply with arithmetic by looking at the linkages on the graph. However, the process that we have described in this section does not require actually looking at the networks, meaning that we can write code to do it for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Optimising the arrangement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can effectively calculate $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ for any given arrangement. We are ready to find the optimal arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brute force search (i.e, calculating\n",
    "$\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ for every possible arrangement and returning the maximum), is not feasible due to the computational complexity, which is $\\Theta(n!)$. For those not familiar with Big O notation and it's variants, I'm just trying to say that it will be bloody slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need an alternative. The problem is that many optimisation algorithms rely on calculus, which requires a continuous independent variable. Our independent variable is the arrangement, which is certainly not continuous,\n",
    "meaning that we cannot use many of these algorithms. How, then, do we approach this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genetic algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A genetic algorithm is a 'shortcut' optimisation method that mimics Darwinian natural selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "A brief summary of Darwin's theory is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  There is a population of **phenotypes**, individual members\n",
    "    with different genetics and hence different characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  This variety means that certain individuals are better suited to\n",
    "    their environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The ‘fitter’ individuals survive and reproduce, passing on their\n",
    "    genetic information to the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  During the process of reproduction, random mutations may occur,\n",
    "    resulting in slight changes to the child phenotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  The process repeats, and over time, the species gets increasingly\n",
    "    better adapted to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an outline of the genetic algorithm to optimise the seating arrangement of our social network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  There is a 'population' of different possible arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Some of these arrangements have a higher $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  These phenotypes survive, and some of the survivors 'reproduce' – their arrangements are somehow combined. In computer science, this step is known as the **crossover**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Random mutations occur, i.e. some arrangements may be changed\n",
    "    slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  The process repeats, and over time, the mean $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ of the population should increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implementing the (pseudo)-genetic algorithm in python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will write python code to find the optimum arrangement for the XKCD network, though of course we could use it for any other network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us represent our network as a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a vector $x_i$.\n"

    "Now that we have a funciton to measure the fitness of an arrangement, we need to find a way to remove the 'weak' individuals, leaving only survivors. Then, we need to let these survivors reproduce. But what does this mean in terms of arrangements and `etotal`s? The first part is simple: we will consider an arrangement to be *weak* if it's $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ is less than the median $\\epsilon_\\text{total}$ (which I think is reasonable). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, once we have the survivors, how can we get them to 'reproduce' to form new arrangements? I thought for a long time about this, and came up with a rather unsatisfactory solution. A child needs to take some traits from the parent, while also having some differences. Therefore I decided to define a child as half of a parent's arrangement, plus the shuffle of the other half. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I know. It's hardly reproduction – more like a glorified form of mutation, but this is why I have titled the post as a *psuedo*-genetic algorithm. If anyone can come up with a better idea for what reproduction could mean in the context of seating arrangements, I'm all ears. \n",
